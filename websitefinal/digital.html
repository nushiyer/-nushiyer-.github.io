    <h2>Why digital?</h2>
    <p>I personally love working digitally, because of Ctrl Z (the undo keys.) While it sounds like a joke, it is so much more helpful than you think. Not only this, but digital art is a whole new realm filled with brushes, design features, and so much more. It is a little bit difficult starting off, especially when someone has been trained to work traditionally for so long, but I have no doubt that anyone can create masterpieces through a computer or a tablet.</p>
    <p>For anyone looking towards a career in design or graphics, digital art is  a great starting point. I have found in my personal experience that Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator is a perfect place to begin learning.</p>
