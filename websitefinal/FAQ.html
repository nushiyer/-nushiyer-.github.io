    <h2>What do you like to do?</h2>
    <p>The short answer is everything. The better answer is everything depends on my mood. Some days I feel like painting a face in acrylic paints and other days I want to do concept art in a digital format. So far there is no definite answer I can give; however, at the moment I am very interested in experimental and graphic design.</p>
    <h2>What do you want to do in the future?</h2>
    <p>The future is something I think about A LOT. Recently, I started considering taking on a career revolcing around industrial design or creative directory. I'm incredibly fascinated with the functionality of technology and hardware, but I also see myself leading an advertising team and discussing product design. One thing I know for sure is no matter what I do, art will be involved.</p>
    <h2>When did you start?</h2>
    <p>If by start you mean draw, then I would say 2 years old. If, however, you mean to say actual painting and more advanced looking art pieces, then 5 years old. I painted a replica of Vincent Van Gogh's famous blue irises in oils when I was that age, so it has been a while. </p>
    <h2>Why do you like it?</h2>
    <p>First of all, I love art. Second, I think it is a perfect way to express yourself and convey inexplicable emotions. For someone who constantly struggles to find words and ust speak in general, art is a wonderful way for me to show my inner feelings and moods.</p>
