    <h2>The Importance of 2D</h2>
    <p>I happen to enjoy working with traditional mediums, isnce I have more experience and knowledge. While this may be a little tougher compared to digital (as there is no easy way to undo a mistake) I still enjoy it just as much. The first medium I ever used was watercolor in preschool and onto oil paints in kindergarten. </p>
    <p>I find it incredibly helpful to have a strong technical background in drawing and sketching as it is very applicale and useful to many things. You can see in the pieces above that I dabble in multiple mediums such as acrylic, watercolor, and even colored pencil. </p>

  <h3>Tips!</h3>
  <p>My only advice here is to practice as much as possible and play around with all sorts of mediums.</p>
