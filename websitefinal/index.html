    <p>Art is an incredibly important aspect of my life, as is best labeled as an outlet for me. I find myself drawing or painting when I am stressed or anxious because the overall process is therapeutic. Not only this, but art opens doors for expression and self reflection. Rather than envoking emotion or a thought via words, art produces the same result through images and appearance.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a little girl, a pencil has always been in my hand. I encourage anyone and everyone to find an outlet whether it is drawing, writing, playing an instrument, etc. I can gurantee that finding a passion or simply a hobby will be one of the best things to happen to you.</p>
